# The Programmer's Brain by Felienne Hermans

## Part 1 - On reading code better

### Chapter 1 - Decoding your confusion when coding

Types of confusions when reading the code:
* **lack of knowledge** - issue in *LTM (Long Term Memory)*
* **lack of information** - issue in *STM (Short Term Memory)*
* **lack of processing power** - Issue in *working memory*

Information -> Filter -> STM (RAM memory)-> Working memory (CPU) -> LTM (SSD disc)


### Chapter 2 - Speed reading for code

LTM supports the limits of STM/working memory. The more we have stored in LTM, the more patterns we're able to 
recognize, and therefore help our STM/working memory do their work.


### Chapter 3 - How to learn programming syntax quickly

Use flashcards with spaced repetitions.


### Chapter 4 - How to read complex code

Cognitive load:
* **Intrinsic load** - how complex is the problem
* **Extraneous load** - what are the outside distractions
* **Germane load** - created by having to store things in LTM

* Techniques to reduce it:
  * refactoring
  * replace unfamiliar code constructs
  

Techniques to help with working memory overload:
* create dependency graph
* use state table


## Part 2 - On thinking about the code

### Chapter 5 - Reaching a deeper understanding of the code

The only part of the chapter that I find interesting or new is a study, that shows, that actually the linguistic 
skills, are a factor when learning programming (not necessarily math). The rest of the chapter is full of 
overthought typologies, which have no real value to me.

### Chapter 6 - Getting better at solving programming problems
