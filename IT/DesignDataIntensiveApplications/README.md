This folder contains ANKI flashcard deck, that I created while reading *"Designing Data Intensive Applications"* book by **Martin Kleppmann**. It was not my aim to create full-blown learning deck. It is more "forget-me-not" kind, and does not cover the whole book. However, I hope it may be of use to you. I have also written kind-of review of this book, <a href="https://michalpiotrowski.dev/2024/07/12/designing-data-intensive-applications-by-martin-kleppmann/">which you can find here</a>.
