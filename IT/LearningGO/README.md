This folder contains ANKI flashcards deck, that contains cards prepared mostly from two sources:
* [Learn GO by tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests)
* [Learning GO book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go-2nd/9781098139285/)

Those two are the main sources I've used when learning GO programming language. The remaining cards are not that 
simple (as I was removing the more obvious ones as I was progressing). However, I am pretty sure that they can still 
be valid source for learning.
