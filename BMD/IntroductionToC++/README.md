This folder contains ANKI flashcards, that I've created while familiarizing myself with C++. Flashcards are based on 
the following sources:

* *'Tour of C++'* by **Bjarne Stroustrup**
* *'C++ Crash Course'* by **Josh Lospinoso**
* [Back to basis CPP Con 2020 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHTh1InhhwT5o3GwbFYy3sR7HDNRA353e)
* Numerous videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon/featured">CPP Con Youtube channel</a>
