# KnowledgeBase
Repository containing all the learning materials I've created along my road to mastery. The final structure is not set up yet,
as I will revisit it every now and then. My goal is to put educational materials that I create for everyone to use.

Of course, I'm not going to limit myself only to IT-related stuff. I plan to share everything that I've read/made notes/flashcards for everyone to benefit.
