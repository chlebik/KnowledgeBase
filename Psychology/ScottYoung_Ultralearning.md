# Ultralearning Accelerate Your Career Master Hard Skills and Outsmart the Competition

## Tenets of ultralearners

### Metalearning

* Why -  kinds of motivations (external/internal). Talk to someone at the level you're aiming for.
* What - concepts/facts/procedures
* How - benchmark and later emphasise/exclude


### Focus

* Starting (avoid procrastination) - "do something" principle, Pomodoro technique
* Sustain
* Optimize the quality

### Directedness

* Project based learning
* Total immersion
* Overkill situations 


### Drill

* Practice then drill
* Types of drilling:
  * Time slicing
  * Cognitive component - drill on one thing but where others are being used too
  * The copycat - practice one thing from others
  * The magnifying glass
  * Prerequisite chaining - start with something too hard, and go back to learn the basics


### Retrieval

* flashcards
* free recall
* the question-book method
* self-generated challenges
* closed-book learning - cut down on hints
 

### Feedback

Based on the output we have 3 types of feedback:
* based on the outcome - works/not
* informational - what are we doing wrong
* corrective - what should be changed/fixed to do better

Techniques for improving feedback:
* noise cancellation
* hit the difficulty sweet spot (deliberate practice)
* metafeedback - evaluate strategy you're using to learn
* high-intensity, rapid feedback
 

### Retention

* spacing
* proceduralization
* overlearning
* mnemonics

### Intuition

### Experimentation 

### Your first ultralearning project

* do your research
  * what topic and what's the scope (SMART)
  * primary resources to use
  * benchmark how others have learned the skill
  * direct practice activities
  * backup materials and drills
* schedule your time - put things in calendar, do a week of test-drive
* execute - go through all the tenets of ultralearning from above and evaluate yourself
* review your results - after the project, no matter the result
* choose to maintain or master further
