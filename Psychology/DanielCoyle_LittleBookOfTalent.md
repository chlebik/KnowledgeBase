## Keep it up<a name="keep"></a>
13. **Find the sweet spot.**

> The key to deep practice is to reach. This means to stretch yourself slightly beyond your current ability,
> spending time in the zone of difficulty called the sweet spot. It means embracing the power of repetition, 
> so the action becomes fast and automatic. It means creating a practice space that enables you to reach and repeat,
> stay engaged, and improve your skills over time.

14. **Take off Your watch.**
15. Break every move down into chunks.
16. Each day, try to build one perfect chunk.

> The real goal isn't practice; it's progress. As John Wooden put it: "Never mistake mere activity for accomplishment."

17. **Embrace struggle (no pain, no gain).**
18. **Choose five minutes a day over an hour a week.**
19. Don't do 'drills'. Instead play small, addictive games.
20. Practice alone.

> "The vision of a champion is someone who is bent over, drenched in sweat, at the point of exhaustion, when
> no one else is watching."

21. Think in images.
22. Pay attention immediately after you make a mistake.

> Develop the habit of attending to your errors right away. Don't wince, don't close your eyes; look straight at them
> and see what really happened, and ask yourself what you can do next to improve. Take mistakes seriously, but never
> personally.

23. Visualize the wires of your brain forming new connections.
24. Visualize the wires getting faster.
25. Shrink the space.
26. Slow it down (even slower than your think).

29. When you get it right, mark the spot.
30. **Take a nap.**
