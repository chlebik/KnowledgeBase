# Restoring Pride

DISCLAIMER: The book is very hard to come by, and it costs quite a lot of money (circa 250$ as it is over 25 years 
old and out of print). Therefore, that's the reason I've put the quotes here, but for those who did not read the 
whole book - it may sound elitist and not politically correct. And the author sees that, hence all the in-depth 
reassurances and explanations that he gives in the book, so that he's not misinterpreted. It may get lost in only 
raw quotes below - that's why I'm putting this warning here - we're not reading 'Mein Kampf' in disguise.



## Part One - What Is Pride?

>   We should face the fact that some people are better as *human beings* than others. Everyone knows that this is 
> true, and while it may be good social policy to pretend otherwise, much is also lost. That is, some people are in 
> fact wiser, more creative, more resourceful, and, in general, more competent in some or many of the ways that 
> count in the world. The corollary of this is that some people are foolish, uncreative, unresourceful, and 
> incompetent in some or even all of the ways that count in the world.


>   What is more to be lamented is that so few people do anything with the strengths that nature has given them. As 
> the ancient Stoics expressed it, most of us have mingled in our being the powers of gods and the mindless impulses 
> of the beasts, and we tend to rest effortlessly on our dead kinship with the latter instead of nourishing and 
> perfecting the divine element in us. Most people have the power to be creative, and some have it in a god-like 
> degree. That is what the pagan philosophers of antiquity were referring to when they wrote of human goodness and 
> happiness. But many people - perhaps even most - are content with the passing pleasures and satisfactions of the 
> animal side of our nature. Indeed, many people will account their lives to be successful if they get through them 
> with only minimal pain, with pleasant diversions from moment to moment and day to day, and the general approval of 
> those around them. And this, notwithstanding that they often have within them the ability to do something which 
> perhaps no human being has ever done. Merely to do what others have done is often safe, and comfortable; but to do 
> something truly original, and do it well, whether it is appreciated by other or not - that is what being human is 
> really all about, and it is what alone justifies the self-love that is pride.


>   The claim, implicit in all egalitarian philosophy and in popular religion, that fools are just as good as their 
> opposites flies in the face of empirical fact and, indeed, no one really believes it anyway. 


>   But, alternatively, you can set for yourself an ideal of personal excellence, and achieve it. Form in your mind a 
> clear idea of what it means to be a genuinely superior human being - superior, that is, *as a person*, and not 
> merely as and adherent to this or that religion, ideology, or group - and then make of yourself that human being. 
> Then, and only then, can you be proud. Your reward may not be honor, riches, or glory - things that are bestowed 
> by others, or more often withheld - but a kind of inner glory and richness. You will see yourself not merely for 
> what you may appear to be to others, but for what you in fact *are*, for what you have made yourself become, and 
> the result, if what you then are is something truly worthy and wonderful, will be pride - that is, the **justified 
> love of yourself**.


>   At this point, obviously we need a definition of pride. It is *the justifiable love of yourself*.


>   No thinker of classical antiquity doubted the value of pride, nor were they in the least confused about what it is.
> Pride was for them the appreciation of one's own special worth and superiority over others. To be proud is to 
> believe that you are in the clearest and truest sense *better* than ordinary people, and to be *correct* in so 
> believing. Pride, in short, was for Aristotle and every other moralist of his culture the justified love of 
> oneself. And the operative word here is *justified*.


>   The nature of genuine pride is thus clear. It is the love of oneself that rests upon some strength or excellence - 
> some *virtue*, in the ancient sense of the term - which is not common to all, something that enables its possessor 
> to stand out among the multitude. A fine athlete can take pride in his or her prowess, for the virtue is perfectly 
> manifest, but someone who merely aspires to such excellence cannot, for such a person has not yet achieved the 
> excellence which is its foundation. 


>   Some might want to insist, of course, that there is in each and every single human being *something* to be proud 
> of. But this is no generalization drawn from experience. On the contrary, experience refutes it. Most people are, 
> in the most ordinary sense, very limited. They pass their time, day after day, in idle, passive pursuits, just 
> looking at things - at games, television, whatever. Or they fill the hours talking, mostly about nothing of 
> significance - of comings and goings, of who is doing what, of the weather, of things forgotten almost as soon as 
> they are mentioned. They have no aspirations for themselves beyond getting through another day doing more or less 
> of what they did yesterday. They walk across the stage of life, leaving everything about as it was when they 
> entered, achieving nothing, aspiring to nothing, having never a profound or even original thought, doing what 
> those around them are doing, getting through life with as little discomfort as possible, and finally leaving 
> behind not so much as a durable memory of themselves. It is, indeed, almost as if they had never been. This is 
> what is common, usual, typical, indeed normal. Relatively few rise much above such plodding existence. They have 
> self-love, to be sure, but in spite of the almost universal conviction that all these masses of people ought, and 
> even deserve, to be proud, they cannot be. The conditions for genuine pride simply do not exist here. For pride is 
> the *justified* love of yourself, and the only thing that can justify such love is your own personal excellence, 
> your own achievements, your own special worth, something which is not the common lot of all.


>   The reward of personal excellence is your knowledge that you possess it.That reward is, in other words, pride. If 
> others heap honors on you for your achievements this is, of course, not unpleasant, but a proud person does not 
> need this. Such a person knows his or her worth, without needing others to proclaim it. If you do a great deed - 
> for example, save the life, health, or fortune of some deserving person through your own strength and wit - then 
> the deed is done, and you know it, without needing praise. You already have your reward. And the beauty of your 
> deed is not that someone was rescued from disaster, no matter how overwhelmingly important that may be to others. 
> Its beauty lies in the strength and with that you displayed, and that is *your* blessing.


>   Personal excellence, therefore, requires no recognition, no authentication by others. More than this, it need not 
> even be recognizable; that is, a person's worth often rests upon some strength or ability which the world might 
> not recognize as of much value even when clearly displayed. Genius, even great genius, can be in small things, in 
> things that most persons might regard as even insignificant. What is required for personal excellence is that its 
> possessor be able to do something with extraordinary skill. It need not be some great or dramatic thing.


>   Such, at any rate, is how we have all been taught to think. The presupposition of absolute equality runs through 
> all our speech and thought, and anyone who raises a doubt about it is viewed with a suspicion of basic evil and 
> bad motive. People who have made themselves wise, learned, creative, resourceful, and strong are admired for 
> possessing these virtues, but they must never speak as though such qualities bestowed and value upon themselves as 
> persons.


>   To live for yourself is to devote your strength, energy, and thought to what is *good* in yourself, and to make it 
> better. It is a quest for personal excellence and nobility. That is something you are capable of attaining; so if 
> you are really concerned with yourself and, literally, with your own good or well-being, then that is what you will 
> try to achieve, putting everything else aside in order to do it. And this means, of course, putting aside any 
> fondness you might have for such things as wealth and status, in favor of what really matters to you, namely, 
> yourself. No one was ever made better as a person by the acquisition of money, or a more powerful position. On the 
> contrary, these are strong forces for the corruption of whatever is good in you. Therefore, if you really, in the 
> the strictest sense, "just live for yourself", then you will scorn specious externals such as these, no matter how 
> they might glitter and tempt you. There is something that glows with more beauty than these, and that is your own 
> nobility as a person.


>   These are the kinds of things that set you apart as good - not necessarily good in the sense of being benevolent, 
> but good in the sense of being an outstanding specimen of the human race. You do not *have* to be ordinary. You do 
> not *have* to be another nothing, or someone who counts for so little because you make no difference anywhere. 
> What your thought, reason and creative power achieve may or may not dazzle the world. The chances are overwhelming 
> that it will not. But that is of little importance. What is important is that you, as a person, will have done 
> something worthwhile that perhaps no one else could do. You will have left the mark of your nobility and goodness 
> on something, and even if it turns out that only you ever see or appreciate that mark, you still will have 
> succeeded in everything that counts. You will indeed have lived for your *self*, and justified your love for 
> yourself. And you can be proud.


>   To do otherwise, to just passively receive pleasant sensations, to eat and drink and reproduce, to merely get 
> through life with the minimum of pain and boredom, is to be no better than a dumb animal.
> Quite apart from any inventory of creative goals, there is one creative pursuit that is open to anyone possessed 
> of imagination, intelligence, courage, and a correct conception of what life is all about. That pursuit is the 
> creation of a life - one's own life. You have within you the power to do something that few others, and possibly 
> no one else, can do. It may be something that, perhaps unpredictably, will leave a mark on the world and make your 
> name known for generations, or more likely, it will turn out to be something that is more or less unnoticed by the 
> rest of the world. That does not matter. It will be noticed by *you*, and you are the only person on earth who 
> needs to be impressed. For remember, you are your own judge, and a severe one. What the rest of the world thinks 
> of you is of little importance.
>   It has its own concerns and values. But what you think of yourself is of overwhelming importance, for you, too, 
> have your own concerns and values. You need only make sure that what concerns you tests and fulfills your own, 
> perhaps unique, creative power, and that your values lie in this direction. You do not have to take your values 
> from others. You do not need to merely absorb what the world offers like a sponge, or imitate others like an ape; 
> however pleasant may be their applause (if it is ever given), the only person whose applause you will really ever 
> need is your own. It is your life, and you are the final judge of it. If you make of your own life a work of art, 
> and it becomes beautiful in your eyes, bearing in mind that your standards are high and severe, then what do you 
> care if the world is blind to the worth of what you have created? You will have satisfied the judge who counts, 
> for that is no one but you.
>   All this sounds straightforward, perhaps even easy, but do not be fooled. This is the way of the proud, and it is 
> uncommon and difficult. It requires  you to cast aside something you have been taught to do almost from the moment 
> you first drew breath. It requires you to disregard, as truly worthless, what others may think of you, and to set 
> your own standard. You have a life to live; that is easy enough. But to create your own life is hard indeed, even 
> though it may be a life of utter simplicity.


>   But you need no special settings or situations to discern this overwhelming need of the multitude to impress 
> others. These people measure their entire worth by what others think of them. In other words, instead of creating 
> their own lives, they let the world create their lives for them. Instead of responding to what they themselves 
> might want, if they but allow themselves to be what they are, they respond to what everyone else wants of them. If 
> wealth is applauded, they seek wealth or, at least, the appearance of it. If status is applauded, the seek this. 
> If piety is upheld, then they feign piety. How they choose, how they vote, what they do with their time, what they 
> do on Sunday, how the dress, how they speak, indeed, how they think and feel - all these are in effect decided by 
> those around them, that is, by everyone *else*, rather than by the only persons entitled to decide them, that is, 
> themselves.


>   If you can at some point look clearly at your own life, and if you can in truth declare to yourself that this life,
> that is, the way you have lived and the things you have achieved, are your own creation, then you can love 
> yourself justifiably. You can be proud. But if to any extent the way you live your life is a response to how 
> others would have you live it, it really is not your life at all, and there is nothing in it to form a basis of 
> pride. Indeed, to the extent that your actions and pursuits are your responses to the will and the approval of 
> other people, you are the very opposite of a proud person, for you are the slave of others. A willing slave, to be 
> sure - but a slave, still.


>   Thus instead of supposing that a work of art must be something that all can behold - a poem, a painting, a book,
> a great building - consider making of your own life a work of art. You have yourself to begin with, and a time of 
> uncertain duration to work on it. You do not have to be what you are, and even though you may be quite content 
> with who and what you are, it will not be hard for you to think of something much greater that you might become. 
> It need not be something spectacular or even something that will attract any notice from others. What it will be 
> is a kind of excellence that you project for yourself, and then attain - something you can then take a look at, 
> with honest self-appraisal, and be proud of.
> The alternative is not very inviting. That is to live out your life, willy-nilly, doing nothing with yourself 
> except going from one day to the next, absorbed in externals, and then, in that inevitable evening of your life, 
> looking back and seeing nothing in yourself, having done nothing with yourself to be proud of. But of course, just 
> as people do not like to dwell upon their own death, neither do they like to look back on their own lives. They 
> would rather dwell on the things around them, things they have affected, things they have wrought, and find their 
> pride in these - in their children, their business, the scenes of their endeavors, everything but themselves.


>   You can, in other words, up to a point, *invent* or *create* your own life. You perhaps cannot be just anything 
> you might aspire to be; you can find out, if you do not already know, by trying. But there is some personal 
> excellence that can be yours. Perhaps you can be a great writer, a composer, a profound thinker, perhaps you can 
> design a new enterprise in which your genius is displayed. Or perhaps it will be something far less dramatic, 
> something that will be little appreciated except by you - yet it is you, as the judge of yourself, who counts. 
> Perhaps your fulfillment will be as a great teacher, though one who, because of the blindness of most people, is 
> not recognized. Perhaps you will learn things of great interest and significance to you, about which the rest of 
> the world cares little or nothing. But the point is this: There is something, whether it is of the least 
> significance to others or not, that you can become; something that, once achieved, you will find deeply and 
> lastingly satisfying. You can then approach the evening of your life knowing, whether anyone else knows it or not, 
> that you did it, and you can be proud. You will then measure your life not by years, but by what is in it, by what 
> you yourself put in it, and then you will more than be at peace with yourself. You will be proud.


>   What Epictetus discovered, following the inspiration of Socrate, was that he was himself his most precious 
> possession, far more important that all the goods of the world, and that it was therefore his mission to perfect 
> himself. You do not let your most precious possession simply rot, through corruption or neglect. You tend and 
> perfect it, and conform it to the ideal standard that your mind and reason disclose.


>   Examples such as these are misleading, however, if they suggest that personal fame, resulting from an impact on 
> the world, are what count. What matters is not the effect upon the world of what you do with your life. What 
> counts is simply what you do with your life. Do you merely live it, or do you create of it something different and 
> precious? Can you, looking at your life, feel what you have actually done? Do not think just of what you have done 
> with the things around you, nor even of what you have done *with yourself*. For personal pride is nothing but the 
> justified love of *yourself*. The pride you take in other things - in your possessions, power, wealth, children, 
> and family - is something else.


>   You have it within you to do something similar; not to compose a speech of a great historical significance, 
> perhaps, but you can create something that is new and precious, something that will serve as a sign, to you if to 
> no one else, of a kind of greatness that lies within you. But to do that, you must first have the will and the 
> determination to do it, and the imagination to discover what it will be, and the wisdom to know that it is of 
> great worth. Do not wait for others to tell you that, and above all, do not turn to others to find it for you, for 
> then it would no longer be yours.


>   Everyone enjoys the sense of superiority, whether in the small things, such as skill at a game, or in the larger 
> gifts and talents that set one apart. To be highly skilled at some relatively insignificant activity, such as 
> checkers and bowling, is pleasant and gives zest to what might otherwise be a dull existence, but things like this 
> add little or nothing to one's excellence as a person. To be highly intelligent, creative, and resourceful in any 
> of those areas around which life itself turns, on the other hand, is not merely pleasant. Such abilities are 
> profoundly gratifying as marks of a genuinely superior human being. You can love checkers, but you can hardly take 
> deep pride in yourself as a person for being good at the game. But if you are good at music, for example, or at 
> science, and, devoting yourself utterly to the pursuit of something like this, you finally excel as a composer, 
> for example, or a researcher, then you are right in taking pride in what you are. You are, to the degree that you 
> succeed in something like this, a person who counts, who is important, and genuine pride rests upon the 
> realization of this.
>   Superiority is one thing, however, and the display of it something quite different. Indeed, if you are a truly 
> proud person you have no interest whatever in exhibiting your worth to those who stand to you as lesser people.


>   But if you are proud, you must not do this. Pride and arrogance not only do not go together, they are 
> anithetical. No truly proud person can be arrogant. Arrogance is the mark of insecurity, of someone whose 
> self-esteem is to some extent lacking and who must, therefore, reinforce it by display.


>   The point being made here applies not only in the larger spheres of life but everywhere. The proud never swagger, 
> and never invite attention to themselves or their achievements. They have no need to. They wish primarily to look 
> good in their own eyes, and have little need for the admiration of others.


>   The proud never do this. They have no need to fabricate virtues, for those they possess are real, whether 
> apparent or not. Proud people wax knowledgeable with respect to those things about which they *are* knowledgeable, 
> and readily admit ignorance about anything else. Pretending to be what you are not, even in the smallest and 
> seemingly insignificant way, is a mark of insecurity, of a sense of shortcoming. If you are ignorant of something, 
> as everyone is, your job is not to try to conceal it but to correct it.


>   Consider, again, what it would mean to say that you are a proud person. It means that you are the creator of an 
> idea, of an excellence that is unique to you; that is in every sense your own, and not some prefabricated ideal 
> handed down to you by any priesthood or by your culture. And you not only create that ideal of what you are going 
> to be, but you achieve it. You have copied no one - it is your own creation. You have sought the applause of no 
> one but yourself, or at least, of yourself primarily. And, because this is true, you have gained a love of self 
> that is justified. You really have become, and have made yourself, what you aspired to be.


>   All this points to a kind of imperative, minimally expressed as: Do something. Better expressed, it says: Create 
> something. To do otherwise is simply to waste your precious life. Do not, as Epictetus expressed it, rest upon 
> your dead kinship with the beasts. All the do is eat, sleep, reproduce, then die and decay. For a person to do no 
> better than that is in effect to lapse into a mere animal.


>   Arrogance is an expression not of pride, but of basic insecurity: One tends to be arrogant to just the extent 
> that he or she is lacking in a sense of true self-worth. It is an attempt to prove, not just to others but to 
> oneself, that one possesses power and, in that sense, superiority over others. 


>   So even if you succeed in misleading others - which, incidentally, is very rare - you will never succeed in 
> misleading yourself. If you have done something stupid, and this is somehow completely concealed forever from the 
> world, you will still know that you have done something stupid. Your aim, then, is not so much to conceal it, 
> since you cannot conceal it from the one person who counts - yourself - but rather, to learn from it. You never 
> need to have much fear of what others think of you, assuming that your blunders do not sink to the level of crimes.
> If you have learned from them, you will have little to fear from what you will henceforth think of yourself.


>   A proud person creates his or her own rules, but we must be careful not to read into this implications that are 
> not there. It does not mean that a proud person is disregardful of others, or that this person is heedless of the 
> basic principles on which civil society rests. Moreover, while the proud live by their own rules, they are also 
> their own judges - and *very severe ones*. This means that the proud set very high standards for themselves. Such 
> persons are not shaken by the deep disapproval of others, although they do care deeply about self-approval. The 
> real failure is failure not in the eyes of others, but in the one's own eyes. This is an essential mark of pride. 



## Part Two - What Is Pride?

## Part Three - Happiness


>   The idea of happiness, we have suggested, contains the idea of *fulfillment*. It is also something of great and 
> perhaps even ultimate value, and, except when destroyed by accident or disaster, it is enduring. It is not 
> something that comes and goes from one hour to the next. We have also said that it is a state of being and not a 
> mere feeling.


>   If we think of happiness as fulfillment, then it must consist of the fulfillment of ourselves as human beings, 
> which means the exercise of our creative powers. For we are, among the creatures of the earth, the only ones 
> possessed of such power. The idea of fulfillment, however, is without meaning apart from the idea of function. 
> Therefore, as our bodies are fulfilled in health, so are our bodies and minds together fulfilled in creative 
> activity.
