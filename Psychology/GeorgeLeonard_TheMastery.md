# The Mastery - The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment

## Part 1 - The master's journey

### Chapter 1 - What is mastery?

It's a ***process*** that never ends. And the growth towards mastery is done in chunks of increase in skill and plateaus.

### Chapter 2 - Meet the Dabbler, The Obsessive and The Hacker

* **Dabbler** - First-class enthusiasm for new things, getting to know new environment, the excitement that
  comes with it is overbearing. But then comes a fallout and plateau and Dabbler just gives up. ***Puer aeternus*** - 
  eternal child.

* **Obsessive** - The main thing is reaching ***the goal***. Right now, at once, on the first try.
  When plateau comes he invests more and more energy and all other things to go further. 

* **Hacker** - The main idea of the hacker is to stay on plateau forever. To get a
  grip and go further - no way. No matter that he could do better, there's no way he is coming out of the comfort zone.

The main takeout is - there's no way to be always one of them. Usually a person is a hacker here, dabbler there, a
little of all of them. The typology above is just to show how we behave.

### Chapter 3 - America's war against mastery

Nowadays' culture is based on the fast-and-quick-climax attitude. No matter how, just win/get high/fix the problem.
In such mindset it's impossible to lay solid foundations for mastery path. 

### Chapter 4 - Loving the plateau

Plateau is a place where 90% of our life takes place (not counting dabbling around over and over in different areas).
Embrace plateau. Feel it. Live it. 


## Part 2 - Five master keys

### Chapter 5 - Key 1 Instruction

To sum up - find a teacher/mentor/guru. Do not reinvent the wheel.

### Chapter 6 - Key 2 Practice

Practice in this chapter is not about a verb. It's about the noun - which should be translated as 'the road' we follow.
Practice not primarily to achieve goal. Practice for the sake of practicing, to keep You focused and concentrated. 
Of course don't hack - don't practice ONLY for the sake of practice if there's no progress in any direction.
**Practice is the path of mastery!**

### Chapter 7 - Key 3 Surrender

Trust the teacher but also surrender to the obvious, repetition-like trivialities. **Satisfaction lies in mindful
repetition, the discovery of endless richness in subtle variations on familiar themes**. What is more important - when the
time comes - surrender whatever You know or can do. Sometimes in order to go along the way of mastery is to go back 
a little. 

### Chapter 8 - Key 4 Intentionality

Picture what You are doing when not doing it. 

### Chapter 9 - Key 5 The edge

Be prepared to walk the edge and also to cross it sometimes. Without it the path would be boring and inhumane.
