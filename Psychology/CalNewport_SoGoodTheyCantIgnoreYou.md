## Rule 1 - Don't follow Your passion<a name="1rule"></a>
1. Real passion is rare
2. Passion takes time (job, career and calling)
3. Passion is a side effect of mastery

## Rule 2 - Be so good they can't ignore You (on the value of skill)<a name="2rule"></a>
1. Craftsman mindset - what value I am producing at job
- *Tape does not lie!*
- *Do not just envy craftsmanship mindset. Emulate it!*
- *deliberate practice*
2. Passion mindset - what job is giving me

How to become a craftsman:
1. Decide what capital market You are in (**all-in** or **auction**).
2. Identify Yor capital type (with **all-in** it's simple, when it comes to **auction** look for open gates).
3. Define 'Good'.
4. Stretch and destroy. (find the **sweetspot** when practising)
5. Be patient.

## Rule 3 - Turn down the promotion (Or, the importance of control)<a name="3rule"></a>

1. Control without career capital is not sustainable.
2. When career capital is high enough to get control, your employer will try to stop you from using it to make a change.
3. To avoid the traps - *do what people want to pay for*.

## Rule 4 - Act small, think big.<a name="4rule"></a>

It is good and important to have a **mission**. It still requires capital and courage however. What is good to use along
the way is **small bets** - incremental small projects that allowes to get feedback quick. And at the end there is
**remarkability** - the mission must stand out in the crow (purple cow).
