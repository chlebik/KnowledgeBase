# The power of full engagement

Principles:
* Full engagements requires drawing on four separate but related sources of energy: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual.
* Because energy capacity diminishes both with overuse and with underuse, we must balance energy expenditure with intermittent energy renewal.
* To build capacity, we must push beyond our normal limits, training in the same systematic way that elite athletes do.
* Positive energy rituals - highly specific routines for managing energy - are the key to full engagement and sustained high performance.


> Performance, health and happiness are grounded in the skillful management of energy.

> To be fully engaged, we must be physically energized, emotionally connected, mentally focused and spiritually aligned with a purpose beyond our immediate self-interest.
> Energy is simply the capacity to do work. Our most fundamental need as human beings is to spend and recover energy.

> We grow at all levels by expending energy beyond our normal limits, and then recovering.

> Physical, emotional and mental energy capacity all feed upon one another.

> 'Where are you, when you get your best ideas?'
