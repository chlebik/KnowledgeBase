# The power of full engagement

> Performance, health and happiness are grouned in the skillful management of energy.

> To be fully engaged, we must be physically energized, emotionally connected, mentally focused and spiritually aligned with a purpose beyond our immediate self-interest.

Principles:
* Full engagements requires drawing on four separate but related sources of enenrgy: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual.
* Because energy capacity diminishes both with overuse and with underuse, we must balance energy expenditure with intermittent energy renewal.
* To build capacity, we must push beyond our normal limits, training in the same systematic way that elite athletes do.
* Positive energy rituals - highly specific routines for managing energy - are the key to full engagement and sustained high performance.
*

> Energy is simply the capacity to do work. Our most fundamental need as human beings is to spend and recover energy.
